# ArcProStreetviewTool
An esri AddIn Tool for showing Google Streetview location via map-click.

This will not show up on any toolbar.  Instead, go to "Options" - "Customize the Ribbon" and search for the tool 'Google Street View' and add to a ribbon of your choice.

By default it will open in it's own dockpane within ArcPro GUI, but you can customize it to open in a separate browser window by default through "Options" - "Google Street View Tool".
